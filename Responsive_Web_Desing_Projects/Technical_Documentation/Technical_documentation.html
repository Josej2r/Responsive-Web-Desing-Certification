            <p>React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook.It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.

An incomplete port for Qt also exists. </p>

            <p>
                This page will help you install and build your first React Native app. If you already have React Native installed, you can skip ahead to the Tutorial.
                <p>
                    If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get
                    you
                    writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out
                    Snack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and
                    running
                    within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
                    <code> npm install -g expo-cli</code>
                    Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":
                    <code>
                        expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
                    </code>
                </p>

                Learn the Basic
            </header>
            <p>React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX,
                components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.

                Let's do this thing. </p>
                <p> Hello World
                    <code>
                        import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
        <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
                    </code>
                </p>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Props">
            <header>
                Props
            </header>
            <p>
                Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props, short for properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, one basic React Native component is the Image. When you create an image, you can use a prop named source to control what image it shows.
<code>
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Image } from 'react-native';

export default class Bananas extends Component {
  render() {
    let pic = {
      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'
    };
    return (
      <Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/>
    );
  }
}

</code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="State">
            <header>
                State
            </header>
            <p>There are two types of data that control a component: props and state. props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use state.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when you want to change it.
            </p>
            <p>For example, let's say we want to make text that blinks all the time. The text itself gets set once when the blinking component gets created, so the text itself is a prop. The "whether the text is currently on or off" changes over time, so that should be kept in state.
<code>
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

class Blink extends Component {

  componentDidMount(){
    // Toggle the state every second
    setInterval(() => (
      this.setState(previousState => (
        { isShowingText: !previousState.isShowingText }
      ))
    ), 1000);
  }

  //state object
  state = { isShowingText: true };

  render() {
    if (!this.state.isShowingText) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <Text>{this.props.text}</Text>
    );
  }
}

export default class BlinkApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Blink text='I love to blink' />
        <Blink text='Yes blinking is so great' />
        <Blink text='Why did they ever take this out of HTML' />
        <Blink text='Look at me look at me look at me' />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

                Style
            </header>
            <p>With React Native, you style your application using JavaScript. All of the core components accept a prop named style. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written using camel casing, e.g. backgroundColor rather than background-color.
            </p>
            <p>The style prop can be a plain old JavaScript object. That's the simplest and what we usually use for example code. You can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, so you can use this to inherit styles.

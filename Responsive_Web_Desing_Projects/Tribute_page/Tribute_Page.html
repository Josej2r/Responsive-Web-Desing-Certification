                    suppose that was exactly what I did."

                By 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of staphylococci.
                He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a
                reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy.
                On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent
                August on holiday with his family. Before leaving for his holiday, he
                had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of
                his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was
                contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci
                immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other
                staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking
                "That's funny".Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his
                former assistant Merlin Pryce, who reminded him, "That's how you
                discovered lysozyme."Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture
                and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of
                disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from
                the genus Penicillium, and, after some months of calling it
                "mould juice", named the substance it released penicillin on 7 March 1929.
